“As mentioned, our workspace can be either dirty or clean, when compared to the currently checked-out commit on the repository. Dirty is not a bad word; it simply implies different. This difference is of course a good thing because those are the changes that we have made, but just have not committed yet. Another source that can make our workspace dirty is autogenerated files and build artifacts. We will later cover how we can make Git ignore certain paths.We can look at our workspace as always being represented by a commit and a changeset or diff applied on top of that. Figure 2-1 shows how the objects are identical in a clean workspace and the repository”
